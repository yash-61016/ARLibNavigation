# Indoor Navigation AR App

This repository contains the source code for a university project for the **Immersive Technology Module**. The app leverages augmented reality (AR) to provide an innovative indoor navigation solution, combining cutting-edge technology with practical functionality.

## Project Overview

The Indoor Navigation AR App was created to explore the use of immersive technologies in solving real-world problems. The app focuses on indoor navigation, providing users with an intuitive and interactive way to navigate complex indoor spaces using AR markers and visual cues.

### Features
- **Augmented Reality Navigation**: Uses AR markers to guide users through indoor spaces
- **Interactive UI**: Provides real-time feedback and visual cues for navigation
- **Customizable Routes**: Allows users to set specific destinations within the mapped area
- **Map Integration**: Includes a base map of the indoor environment for reference

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Game Engine**: Unity
- **AR Framework**: AR Core
- **Platform**: Android (depending on deployment target)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2020.3 or newer
- AR Core compatible device
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yash-61016/ARLibNavigation.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity:
   - Launch Unity Hub
   - Click "Add" and browse to the cloned repository folder
   - Open the project

3. Build and Run:
   - Connect your AR Core compatible device
   - In Unity, go to File > Build Settings
   - Select your target platform (Android)
   - Click "Build and Run"

## Usage

### Launching the App
1. Open the application on your device
2. Allow camera permissions when prompted
3. Point your camera at a flat surface to initialize AR tracking
4. The app will detect AR markers and display navigation paths

### Navigation
- Follow the AR visual cues (arrows, paths, etc.) displayed on your screen
- The app will update the route in real-time as you move through the space

## Development

This project was developed using:
- C# programming language
- Unity as the primary development environment
- Google's AR Core for augmented reality functionality

## Academic Context

This application was created as part of the Immersive Technology Module at university. The project demonstrates the practical application of AR technology in solving navigation challenges in indoor environments where GPS signals are unreliable.
